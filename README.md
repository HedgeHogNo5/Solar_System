# Solar_System
This is a basic computer model of the solar syatem. 
How to use these Files:
Particle.py contains my particle class defining the particle and the graviatational acceleration on that particle by surrounding particles
Simulation.py contains all the bodies of the inner solar system that I passed through the particle class. This is the file you can use to reproduce the simulations. It also defines the time passed and will makes a deep save to a .npy file called bodies
Plotter.py will plot a graph using the data saved to the deepsave "bodies"
